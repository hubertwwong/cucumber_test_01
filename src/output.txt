Feature: Showcase the simplest possible Cucumber scenario
  In order to verify that cucumber is installed and configured correctly
  As an aspiring BDD fanatic 
  I should be able to run this scenario and see that the steps pass (green like a cuke)

  Scenario: Cutting vegetables          # features/first.feature:7
    Given a cucumber that is 30 cm long # features/step_definitions/first_feature.rb:1
    When I cut it in halves             # features/step_definitions/first_feature.rb:6
    Then I have two cucumbers           # features/step_definitions/first_feature.rb:13
      undefined method `should' for 2:Fixnum (NoMethodError)
      features/first.feature:10:in `Then I have two cucumbers'
    And both are 15 cm long             # features/step_definitions/first_feature.rb:18

Failing Scenarios:
cucumber features/first.feature:7 # Scenario: Cutting vegetables

1 scenario (1 failed)
4 steps (1 failed, 1 skipped, 2 passed)
