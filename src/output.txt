Feature: Showcase the simplest possible Cucumber scenario
  In order to verify that cucumber is installed and configured correctly
  As an aspiring BDD fanatic 
  I should be able to run this scenario and see that the steps pass (green like a cuke)

  Scenario: Cutting vegetables          # features/first.feature:7
    Given a cucumber that is 30 cm long # features/first.feature:8
    When I cut it in halves             # features/first.feature:9
    Then I have two cucumbers           # features/first.feature:10
    And both are 15 cm long             # features/step_definitions/first_feature.rb:14

1 scenario (1 undefined)
4 steps (1 skipped, 3 undefined)

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^a cucumber that is (\d+) cm long$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When(/^I cut it in halves$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then(/^I have two cucumbers$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
